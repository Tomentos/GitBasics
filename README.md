# Joyce Tech Tutorial Archive

Hello to whoever may have come across this repository.

This is my personal Joyce Tech Tutorial Archive where I save various tutorials that I have created on [the official Joyce Tech Tutorial Discord Server](https://discord.gg/joyce) to try and help people find their footing in technology. Feel free to browse this repo or even join the server.

Here is a list of shortcuts to all tutorials I have made:
- [Git Basics Tutorial (Advance your coding projects with Git)](/GitBasics/GitBasics.md)
- [Networking 101: The Fucking Basics](/Networking_101/Networking_101.md)
- [Networking 102: No more swearing](/Networking_102/Networking_102.md)
- [Networking 103: I know where your PC lives](Networking_103/Networking_103.md)
