# Networking 102 - No more swearing

I promised and I decided to not wait 3 months this time. The Networking 101 lesson got incredibly positive reactions and I also got requests for the second lesson already. So here I am. This lesson will focus on every device / service in a modern network. This also includes IP Addresses but only to a very small extent.
